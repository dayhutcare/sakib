The blue circle of the mouse cursor is so slow. Make the blue cursor so fast that it can travel with the mouse without any delay, and in high FPS mode. The send message animation should only occur if the user fills in all the information, otherwise, a pop-up will appear, which will tell the user to fill in all the information.  Increase the particles of the background a little bit.  There is a bug in the skill loader. The loading animation should happen rapidly after appearing in the screen. But it takes so long to occur the animation. Fix that. The theme should follow the device theme. I mean, if the device's dark mode is off, the website will be open in the light theme. If the device's dark mode is enabled, the website will be open in dark theme. Make the background animation a little bit colourful and effective.
